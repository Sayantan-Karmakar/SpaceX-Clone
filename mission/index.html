    <h1 id="slider-quote-02">SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only
      private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 our Dragon spacecraft became
      the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station. And in 2020, SpaceX
      became the first private company to take humans there as well. Click through the timeline above to see some of our
      milestone accomplishments.</h1>

      <h3 id="re-text">REUSABILITY</h3>
      <h1 id="re-text2">SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to
        substantially reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket,
        which historically has flown only once.

        Compare that to a commercial airliner – each new plane costs about the same as Falcon 9 but can fly multiple
        times per day and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the commercial model, a
        rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of traveling to space by a hundredfold.

        While most rockets are designed to burn up on reentry, SpaceX rockets can not only withstand reentry but can
        also successfully land back on Earth and refly again.</h1>
